In this Kaggle competition that we were assignned as our homework 3 we needed to build and train a model to be able to identify photos of people, to determine if the photo of the person was one of a person wearing a hat or not wearing a hat. I decided to use the CelebA dataset that was provided to train my model from because it was a fairly perfect dataset to build from. A rather large set of images that already had an attribute of hat or no hat. I took this approach since I knew finding my own dataset or building my own data set would take an immense amount of time which I did not have as this assignment fell in the middle of midterms. For this model I used a tensorflow pipline and used only a portion of the images in the CelebA dataset. I originally did a portion of the dataset as a precautionary measure to ensure that the model did not take too long but it ended up being one of the factors that improved my score. After floundering in attemping to use a Kaggle environment for the first time I was able to produce my with result which was a ~0.5 which was basically the same as guessing. On this initial submission I remembered that I only used 8 epochs so I raised it to the 20 epochs I originally intended. After doing so I reached a score of ~0.59 which would be my best for a while. I tried changing small parameters and refractoring the whole code and all of which gave me worse results. Even raising the training data of CelebA from 5k to 10k actually gave me a worse score. What did end up giving me a better score was using the best version and just raising the CelebA dataset from 5k to 6k instead. What was also difficult about this project was that the smallest tweak would takes ages to test since running the model would take anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 mintues. So this barrier to testing made it difficult to make quick adjustments to see what would work best with my model.
